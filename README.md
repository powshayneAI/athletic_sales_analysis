# athletic_sales_analysis

In this challenge, we were tasked with merging the data of different Dataframes.
This was done using one of the following Pandas functions:
- Merge
- Concat
- Join

After doing so, we were tasked with using two functions:
- groupby
- pivot_table
to gather certain parts of the data contained within the original dataframe. The
results of these functions are conclusively the same.

Lastly, we were tasked with determining which Retailer had sold the most
women's athletic footwear using the groupby and pivot_table functions, however,
we also utilized the resample function to conclude the weekly and daily total sales of 
invoice data.
